    """
    Implemenation wise, this wraps a WavePropagator to do the majority of the work.

    The only thing this class handles is conversion of tile objects into sets of patterns
    and co-ordinate conversion.
    TilePropagator is the main entrypoint to the DeBroglie library.
    It takes a `TileModel` and an output `Topology` and generates
    an output array using those parameters.
